        >A particle is moving around in a circle and its position is given in polar coordinates as x = Rcosθ, and y = Rsinθ, where R is the radius of the circle, and θ is in radians. From these equations derive the equation for centripetal acceleration.

        > Displacement is vector quantity, meaning it has a magnitude and a direction.
        The displacement of an object that moves from point A to point B is a vector whose tail is
        at A and whose tip is at B. The distance equals the total distance covered from point A to B. If I started from         point A and travels in a circular motion and ends back at position A the displacement would equal 0 where as the        distance would the circumference of the circle.  Since the displacement is a vector quantity, it is not enough          to say that the displacement is 100 meters: you must also state the direction of that displacement.
