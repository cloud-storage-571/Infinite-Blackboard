    <string name="Vel_1">Lets start with the definition of velocity.</string>
    <string name="Vel_2">We say that velocity is defined as distance over time.</string>
    <string name="Vel_3">Of course we mean the distance traveled over the time it takes to get there. So it\'s a change of time.</string>
    <string name="Vel_4">We will see why it\'s important to think in terms of "the change of" in the definition when we talk about acceleration.</string>
    <string name="Vel_5">Now, this certainly one way of defining velocity, but there is another way of saying the same thing.</string>
    <string name="Vel_6">We could also say that the distance traveled is proportional to the time of travel, and velocity is the proportionality constant.</string>
    <string name="Vel_7">Thinking of distance as the product of velocity and time allows us to visualize this idea with a picture we can draw on the blackbord.</string>
    <string name="Vel_8">Let\'s start with trying to think about velocity in a different direction.</string>

    <string name="question">
        A particle is moving around in a circle and its position is given in polar coordinates as x = Rcosθ, and y = Rsinθ, where R is the radius of the circle, and θ is in radians. From these equations derive the equation for centripetal acceleration.

    <string name="displacement1">
        Let’s understand the differences between distance and displacement. Displacement is vector quantity, meaning it has magnitude and a direction.
            Distance is scalar quantity meaning it only has magnitude. If I started from point A and travels in a circular motion and ends back at position A the displacement would equal 0, where as the distance equals the total distance covered from point A to B.  Since the displacement is a vector quantity, it is not enough to say that the displacement is 100 meters: you must also state the direction of that displacement.

    <string name="speed1">
        In everyday use and in kinematics, the speed of an object is the magnitude of its velocity (the rate of change of its position).

    <string name="velocity1">
        Velocity is the rate of change of the displacement,Δx. It is the difference between the final and initial position of an object.

    <string name="acceleration1">
        Speed and velocity only deal with movement at a constant rate. When we speed up, slow down, or change direction, we want to know our acceleration.
    </string>

    <string name="acceleration2">
        "Acceleration, in physics, is the rate of change of velocity of an object. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all forces acting on the object, as described by Newton's Second Law."

    <string name="twod_motion1">
        2-dimensional motion is just like 1-dimensional motion, but with two directions to consider instead of just one! With 2D motion, we must now consider both horizontal motion and vertical motion at the same time! This is often portrayed through projectile motion. Projectile motion is when an object is traveling in freefall, but is also traveling horizontally simultaneously. A projectile\'s velocity changes in the vertical direction, but remains constant in the horizontal direction.
    </string>

    <string name="twod_motion2">
        A very common example of this is shooting a cannonball out of a cannon. The path of the cannonball often follows a parabolic path that not only travels vertically, but horizontally as well! We\'ll be using the four kinematic equations to determine the displacement, time, velocity, or acceleration at any given moment during the projectile\'s motion.
    </string>

    <string name="twod_motionQuestion">
        If a cannonball has an initial velocity of 860 m/s, what distance away does the cannonball hit the ground when shot from the cannon at a 45 degree angle with the horizontal?
